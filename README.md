# Pure Invoices

### Simple, Secure, and Built for Speed.

**Pure Invoices** is a streamlined virtual invoicing platform designed for service-based businesses that value simplicity over complexity. Built on the philosophy that invoicing tools should be fast and focused, it avoids the bloat of traditional accounting software to provide a seamless experience for both senders and recipients.

## The Mission

Pure Invoices was born out of frustration with existing tools that became overly complex and expensive. Our mission is to keep it simple: **a platform that does invoicing really well, without unnecessary features.**

We focus on the essentials: professional presentation, secure delivery, and getting you paid faster.

## Key Features

- **Secure Links:** Generate unique, shareable web-based links for every invoice. No more lost PDFs or bulky email attachments.
- **Data Snapshots:** Business and Client information is snapshotted at the moment of invoice creation, ensuring your historical records remain accurate even if you update your profiles later.
- **Estimates to Invoices:** Create professional estimates and convert them to active invoices with a single click once approved.
- **Flexible Payments:** Support for manual payment links (Venmo, PayPal, CashApp) and fully integrated Stripe payments.
- **Client Management:** Maintain a lightweight CRM of your clients and their billing history.

## Tech Stack

The project is built with a modern, high-performance stack:

- **Frontend:** React and Tailwind CSS.
